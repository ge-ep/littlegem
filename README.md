<h1>Little Gem Pre-amp PCB</h1>
<p>This is a PCB of the "Little Gem" pre-amp as described on the fluxmonkey website. I put this together as I thought it would be useful and I might as well share it around.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Please note:</b> if you are reading this it means the PCB is currently untested, so if you make any of these, you do so knowing that it may be a dud. I mean it <i>should</i> work, but I can't say that with any certainty, so do with that what you will. I'll update this once I've actually tested it.</p>
